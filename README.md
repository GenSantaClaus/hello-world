# hello-world
just a Taiwanese student getting started, hoping to know more and make new friends
while I was major in food science in college, I also attend a online class on Udacity. 
Where I learned a bit about android and java.
after that, I attended a java class in my school. I really like how my teacher teach us about java. She doesn't just tell us how to code but also guide us how to think like a coder.
So here I am, exploring a new world.
